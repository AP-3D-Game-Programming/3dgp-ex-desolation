# DESOLATION—--____—-----__—-__–
## —___—---__—-----__The Awakening
*You wake up, not knowing where you are, or who you are, on a table, in the middle of a lab.* 

*The only light comes from a flickering emergency light.*

*You spot a walkie talkie and a gun, an old revolver, you don’t know it yet, but when you pull the trigger the gun won’t work.*

A sudden voice.
- “Hello? Can you hear me? Oh, thank god. You're awake. Don't worry, I'm going to get you out of here.”


- You whisper “Where am I? Who are you?”


*The walkie talkie remains silent. Noises in the distance intensify, you can't quite make something of it.*

It starts crackling again “My name doesn't matter right now. What matters is that this lab... it's compromised. The exit is blocked. But I've been watching the security feeds. I can guide you through the back sectors. Do exactly as I say.”

### A LOUD BANG, somwehre in the distance, noises intensify

- “We need to move. Through the double doors, straight ahead. Now.”

*You try and open the door, it doesn’t work… the door is clearly powered down , there is panel next to the door, clearly dead. “New Battery Required”;*

A bit further, after a stack of old notebooks, covered in blood, lays a new battery, you plug it in and the panel powers on, there s a single light in the room that starts flickering violently, the door is unlocked.
